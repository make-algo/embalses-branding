# Walkthrough - Embalses App Setup

I have successfully set up the React application with the requested themes.

## Steps Taken
1.  Initialized a new Vite project.
2.  Downgraded Vite to version 5 to ensure compatibility with Node.js 20.11.0.
3.  Created the application files (`main.jsx`, `App.jsx`, `styles/index.css`, `styles/themes.css`).
4.  Fixed a CSS import order issue in `themes.css`.
5.  Started the development server.

## Application Status
The application is running at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/).
